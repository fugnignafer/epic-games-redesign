# Epic Games Redesign Description

The first change I made was to reduce the size of the carousel. I did this because the carousel sacrificed a lot space that could be useful to making the site more traversable. It also reduces the chance the image becomes pixelated on larger screens.

I also changed the carousel from having 4 different slides visible at once to having a single one with a wider picture. While this does make it marginally more difficult for a user to see the other products immediately, it does maximize the visibility of each individual image and removes the feeling of “crampedness”. 

I did not make many edits on the top bar except move the “Unreal Engine” tag between the help and news, since the unreal engine page should be read before the help page, and making the main image extend into the search bar. This makes the image seem a bit more dynamic. The primary color would become the color of the bar, and the white text would have a shadow effect on different images.

There is a new carousel under the main carousel, displaying various logos of Epic Games products. The carousel would move if the mouse approaches the edge.

After the carousel, I added a video that would involve displaying the graphics of the Unreal Engine, and various short clips of gameplay. Next to it would be a title describing the types products Epic Games offers, and some type of slogan on top. I am not a copywriter, and I did not want to misrepresent the views of epic games, so I left dummy text in its place.

Finally, I also darkened the color of the original page a bit in order to give a bit more contrast to the images and backgrounds.
